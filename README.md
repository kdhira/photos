# Photos (Google Photos Album Portal)

This is a mini project that displays Google Photos Albums, with links to them,
as Google Photos doesn't have a profile with public albums per se.

This web interface will leverage the Jekyll templating paradigm and the
bootstrap framework.

The site will be served at [http://kevinhira.com/photos](http://kevinhira.com/photos)
